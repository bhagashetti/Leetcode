Problem Statement: Given an array of size N. Find the highest and lowest frequency element.

Pre-requisite: Hashing Theory and  Counting frequencies of array elements

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: array[] = {10,5,10,15,10,5};
Output: 10 15
Explanation: The frequency of 10 is 3, i.e. the highest and the frequency of 15 is 1 i.e. the lowest.

Example 2:

Input: array[] = {2,2,3,4,4,2};
Output: 2 3
Explanation: The frequency of 2 is 3, i.e. the highest and the frequency of 3 is 1 i.e. the lowest.
