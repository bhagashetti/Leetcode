Given a linked list with the head node and a key, the task is to check if the key is present in the linked list or not. Return true if key is present, else return false.

Example:

Input: key = 3,
      
Output: true
Explanation: 3 is present in Linked List.

Input: key = 4,
   
Output: false
Explanation: 4 is not present in Linked List.

Constraint:
1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node.data, key ≤ 105
